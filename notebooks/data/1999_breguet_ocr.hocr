ABSTRACT

This paper presents innovative concepts developed at
the “Institut de s nes robotiques” for the realisation
of high precision micro-manipulators.

Our approach allows to design compact, light and
reliable mechanisms. Piezoceramic micro-actuators,
flexible bearings and end-effectors in shape memory
alloys are descibed and illustrated with several
prototypes.

The proposed concepts satify remarkably well the in-
flight space experiments requirements and are believed
to be excellent candidates to be used in embarked
“Microlabs”’.

1, INTRODUCTION

Since the beginning of the nineties, the industry of
Microsystems asks for a miniaturization of the
production tools (i.e. machines and production
facilities), the goal being to reduce weight, volume and
power consumption and finally, to reduce the
production costs. At the same time, immunity of the
systems against environmental perturbations, such as
vibrations or temperature fluctuations is improved. In
the academic community, this concept is generally
called miniature-factory or “Microfactory”. It refers to a
set of cooperating machines in a tabletop containment to
produce, process and manipulate micro-devices [1].

The Microfactory characteristics satisfy remarkably
well the in-flight space experiment requirements and
could soundly be used to realize embarked "Microlabs".
This paper describes innovative approaches for the
design of actuators, mechanical structures and end-
effectors, all dedicated to Microfactories or Microlabs.
The proposed solutions are simple and highly reliable.
Our approach is illustrated in this paper with several
examples.

2. PIEZOCERAMIC MICRO-ACTUATORS

In the frame of the Microlab concept, “stick and slip
actuators” are characterized by their remarkable
simplicity. Without any precision mechanical parts, nor
delicate assembly processes, and using low cost
material, we can design micro-manipulators with

nanometer resolutions and large wokspaces (several
cubic centimeters) [2].

2.1 Operating principle

An inertial mass (slider) is supported and guided by
gs (figure 1). Two modes of operation are
defined, viz. stepping- and scanning-modes.

In the stepping-mode, each step consists of a slow
deformation of the legs followed by an abrupt jump
backward. During the slow deformation the ma:
follows the legs because of friction (stick), whereas it
cannot follow the sudden jump because of its inertia
(slip).

The stepping mode allows long displacements at a
relatively high speed (typically 5 mm/s). The resolution
is limited to a step or so (200 nm).

Once the position is within less than a step distance of
the target, the legs are deformed slowly until the final
position is reached. In this mode, called scanning-mode,
the resolution is a fraction of a step (typically better than
5 nm).

2.3 Prototypes

Several micro-manipulators using Stick and Slip
Actuators have been developed and tested at ISR. Some
of them are integrated in micro-assembly or micro-
telemanipulation systems.

Simplicity, rigidity, high resolution and easiness of
integration into a system are the main features we have
considered during the development of our micro-
manipulation systems.

2.3.1 A six degrees-of-freedom platform

Stick and Slip Actuators can easily be integrated into
complex mechanical structures. Figure 3 shows a
parallel kinematics actuated by three Stick and Slip
Actuators, each of them having 2-DOF. The platform
has thus 6-DOF (3 translations and 3 rotations).

Figure 3: 6 degrees-of-freedom platform.

Its workspace is evaluated at about 140 mm}, for an
overall volume of the structure smaller than 4 cm’. The
maximum payload is 0.1 N [4].

Such platform could be used, for example, to position
and orientate samples under a microscope.

2.3.2 A three degrees-of-freedom mobile micro-robot
An innovative concept, named “Monolithic
Piezoceramics Flexible Structures”, has been invented
at ISR allowing to design extremely simple mobile
micro-robots [5].

Figure 4 shows a picture and exploded view of a 3-DOF
mobile micro-robot composed of only 6 simple
mechanical parts.

These micro-robots have a resolution of a few
nanometers and a maximum speed as high as 3 mm/s.
Their workspaces are limited only by the table on which
they are moving (and the length of the wires). A

2.4 A few examples of application

A similar micro-robot was used to carry a micro-
electrode and make micro-EDM machining. A vertical
axis was added to obtain the fourth degree-of-freedom
required by this application. Die-sinking and milling
experiments, without rotation of the electrode, were
done on cover glass in automatic and manual modes.
Typical milling speeds were 0.5 mm/s [6].

Replacing the electrode by a micro-gripper, the robot
was used in an experimental setup for micro-assembly
(figure 5). The goal was to insert the rotor of an
electrostatic motor into its stator. The clearance was 2
um. The diameter of the rotor was 250 um for a
thickness of 150 um. The micro-robot is placed under
an optical microscope. A 3-D vision system provides a
position feedback with submicron accuracy. The system
successfully completed the insertion operation in
automatic and manual modes [7].

Figure 5: Micro-assembly system.

Finally a micro-telemanipulation system for biological
specimens was developed. The micro-manipulator can
carry micro-tools such as micro-electrodes or micro-
pipettes to operate with a nanometr accuracy on
biological tissues or cells [8].
3. MONOLITHIC FLEXIBLE MECHANICAL
STRUCTURES

In many cases an inappropriate mechanical structure for
a manipulator can be an insurmountable limiting factor
to its precision. For example backlash or friction can
hardly be overcome by sensors or controllers. An
efficient approach to this problem is to use a new
concept of structures specially dedicated to high
precision micro-manipulators. It consists in replacing
the traditional rolling or plain bearings by flexible
bearings. We present here the advantages of flexures
compared to traditional bearings then we show some
examples of original flexures and a 3 degrees-of-
freedom high precision micro-manipulator.

Like plain or rolling bearings, flexures are joints

connecting solid members and permitting relative

motion in some directions while constraining motion in
others. But whereas the two former types of bearings
rely upon the friction or rolling of solid bodies on each
other, flexures use the elastic properties of matter. This
brings numerous advantages for high precision

mechanisms [9]:

- Absence of friction : plain or rolling contact between
solids inevitably generates friction which alters the
joint's functioning. Friction dissipates energy,
provoking mechanical hysteresis. At low speed it
causes halting motion due to the "stick & slip"
phenomenon which limits the resolution of the
movements. Finally friction is at the origin of wear.
Flexure are free from all solid friction. Solely remains
the internal friction of matter which is practically
negligible.

- Absence of wear : wear reduces the precision of plain
and rolling bearings because it alters their geometry
and increases their mechanical play. Moreover, it is
the principal factor limiting their life-time. Flexures do
not suffer from these drawbacks and have their life-
time limited only by the eventual fatigue of the
material. Good design maintaining the stresses below
the fatigue limit allow to guarantee almost infinite life-
times.

- Absence of mechanical play : to reach high precision,
plain and rolling bearings often require complicated
play compensation. Per definition, flexures have no
play.

- High rigidities : the more rigid the mechanical
structures of machines, the more precise they are
statically (when external loads are applied) and
dynamically (when vibrations occur). The rigidity of
rolling bearings depend on the pressure of rolling
elements on top of a rolling surface. With small
bearings, the small radiuses of the rolling elements
limits the rigidity. Well designed flexures can be much
more rigid than rolling bearings.

- Compact and monolithic structures : plain and rolling
bearings are made of many mechanical parts which are
assembled. This assembly increases their bulkiness

and reduces their construction precision. Wire-
electrodischarge machining allows to manufacture
very complex flexible structures monolithically, hence
very compact and precise.

- Immunity to contamination : the wear and required
lubrication of plain and rolling bearings frees particles
of matter which can pollute the air of clean rooms. On
the contrary, when used in dirty environments, dust
can easily perturb or even block these bearings.
Flexures are perfectly clean and are not affected by
dirt.

The main limitation of flexures is their range of motion
which must be restricted to avoid intolerable stresses
inside the material. This calls for flexible parts with ever
thinner cross-sections. Wire-electrodischarge machining
allows to manufactures flexible parts having thicknesses
of a few tens of microns with relatively long motion
ranges. Much work is done to establish efficient models
to predict the behavior of such thin flexures [10].

composed of three monolithic arms (tempered steel)
connected to the moving platform on top. Each arm is
actuated by a screw-nut system and a DC motor with
encoder. The resolution of each axis is better than
0.8um. The linear motion range of the robot is +5mm,
the angular motion range is +7°. (The EPFL sticker is
60mm long).

4, SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS END-EFFECTORS

Shape Memory alloys (SMA) provide a simple,
compact, lightweight, lubricant-less and shock-less
solution in the field of actuator for space engineering.
They have been successfully introduced in several space
applications like for deployment structures (Rapana
truss on the orbital station MIR) [11], releasing
mechanisms (solar panels on Clementine spacecraft)
[12] as well as small actuators (Material Adhesion
Experiment on Mars pathfinder) [13]. Moreover, among
all actuators, Shape Memory Alloys have the best
force/weight ratio in the micron scale world. They can
deliver a very large force in a narrow space, which
makes these alloys attractive for micro-engineering
applications. Until today, most of SMA micro-systems
use only the SMA as the actuator combined with others
mechanical parts like pullback springs, guiding systems,
etc. All these systems are not suitable for very small
applications (dimensions less than a few millimeters)

because of the assembly of microelements and in some
cases, the friction between mechanical elements.

A new concept of monolithic SMA mechanism has been
developed in our laboratory. This concept consists i
considering the SMA not only as a part of a mechanism
but as a mechanism in itself [14]. In the case of a
microgripper, the actuator, the jaws and the pullback
spring are all included within the same piece of
material. This allows us to create versatile, simple, easy-
to-assemble, sub-millimeter and powerful microgripper.

A first design was developed in the framework of an
industrial project where the goal was to develop and
automatize the assembly of micro-endoscopes. The
challenge was to carefully manipulate small cylindrical
micro-lenses with diameters of 0.25 to 0.35 millimeters.

A first prototype of microgripper consists of a small
piece of one-square millimeter SMA material (NiTiCu).
The gripper has one moving arm, which closes on
heating and opens on cooling. The reversible motion is
done by using the so-called, Two-Way-Shape-Memory-
Effect (TWSME). This effect appears when the material
is submitted to a training process, which consists in a
constrained thermal cycling of the material.

Figure 10 : The Two-Way-Shape Memory micro-gripper

3. A match.

The main characteristics are:

- Maximum grasping force: 16 mN

- Weigth: < 1 mg

- Size: around 1 mm

- Thickness: 0.17 mm

- Material: NiTiCu

- Machined by laser

- Power consumption: around 0.4 W*
- Activation temperature: 60 to 80°C*
* Depends on the SMA material used.

The gripper has been tested for 200'000 cycles of lenses
grasping (the fatigue characteristic shows saturation
after 200'000 cycles).
The main advantage of this device is the simplicity of
fabrication and actuation. It can be used in special
environments like clean-rooms, vacuum or zero gravity.

5. CONCLUSION

The increasing number of experiments run in micro-
gravity will necessary lead to the development of a new
kind of laboratory equipment dedicated to space.

The ISR does not have any experience in this field yet,

nevertehless, the microfactory concepts presented in this

paper have many similarities with the space

requirements :

- small weigh and dimensions;

- low energy consumption;

- work in vacuum or controlled atmospheres;

- handling strategies for micro-parts adapted to micro-
gravity;

- immunity to chocks and vibrations.

Hence we believe that these new design approaches can
be of great use for the realization of Microlabs to be
embarked in space.
