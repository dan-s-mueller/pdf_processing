ABSTRACT

Very Broad Band seismometers are the best instruments
for studying internal structure of telluric planets [1].
Development of such instrument dedicated to Mars
observation take up a real instrumental challenge. In
fact they must be able to :

- detect ground displacement of a few 10 pm ina
bandwidth from DC to 20 Hz in the 3
directions,

- have a very low sensitivity to temperature,
pressure, gravity...

- be installed automatically on any ground,

- have a low mass ( < 2 kg with the installing
devices) a low volume and low power
consumption (< 1 W),

- resist to landing shock, usually close to 200 g.

Such instrument [2] have been developed by IPGP and
INSU, with the industrial collaboration of SODERN,
under an R&D contract from CNES. It will be part of
each lander of the Netlander mission, which plan to
deploy 4 small stations on Martian ground in 2006, to
perform a geophysical study of this planet.

1. INTRODUCTION

A seismometer is an instrument which measures the

local acceleration variation of the ground where it is
installed. Such data contain signals related to the
seismic and tidal activity of the planet. Analysis of these
data has permitted, this century, a better understanding
of the mechanisms involved in the seismic events. At
the beginning of the 80's, progresses in seismic
instrumentation have permitted the realization of a new
kind of seismometer : the Very Broad Band instruments.
These sensors like the STS-1 and STS-2, by Streckeisen
[3], and the CMG-3, by Guralp [4], are mainly
characterized by a high sensitivity (better than 10”
m.s ? VHz) and two different outputs :

- a velocity one, dedicated to the record of
seismic signal issued typically from
earthquakes (bandwidth : 360 s or 120 s up to
20 Hz),

- a position or tidal one, dedicated to the record
of tidal signals, liquid and solid (bandwidth :
DC to 360 s or 120s).

These seismometers, oftenly used in Very Broad Band
seismic network like IRIS for the USA or GEOSCOPE
for France, still remain as references in seismic
instrumentation. High quality of data provided by such
sensors has permitted to establish the first 3D models of
our planet, giving us the details of its internal structure.
It is so theoretically possible to use these types of
sensors to perform the same analysis for a telluric planet
of our solar system.
Mars is the best candidate for such analysis due
to the many similitudes existing between this planet and
the Earth, and in consequence due to the many missions
programmed toward this destination. Our knowledge
about this planet will permit a better understanding of
origin and future of the solar system telluric planets.
The problem of using VBB terrestrial sensors is :

- they are too heavy (between 25 and 60 kg),

- they are too much power consuming (between
5 and 10 W),

- they are very sensitive to pressure and
temperature,

- they are not very robust,

- they need a human presence to be installed...

In that respect, they have no capability to be used in
spatial application. Moreover, Martian seismic activity
is expected to be 2 or 3 order of magnitude lower than
the Earth one, so their sensitivity for such measurement
is problematic.

The challenge we are facing is then : doing better with

low mass and volume.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE SENSOR :

A seismometer is usually composed of two
subassemblies : a mechanical one and the electronics.

2.1 : The mechanical subassembly :

The mechanical part consists in fact in a pendulum
realized using a spring supporting a mobile mass (Fig.
1). Its function is to convert the acceleration applied on
it, into a displacement of its mass.

Figure 1 : Principe of a vertical seismometer.

Mathematics equation describing the behavior of such
pendulum shows that, in the useful bandwidth : for
frequency lower than the resonant frequency, the
sensitivity (Eq. 1) is proportional to the mass (m) of the
mobile part and to the inverse of the spring stiffness (k).

For terrestrial instruments the best way to reach a high
mechanical sensitivity (about 10? s?) is to use a
relatively heavy mass, which imply to use spring with
an important size. In fact, springs used are subjected to
high deformation loading, which requires important
volume. That explains the consequent volume and mass
necessary for these sensors.

The concept used in our sensor can be called
‘inverted tilted pendulum’ (Fig. 2).

Figure 2 : Principe of our ‘inverted tilted pendulum’.

Such disposition permits a higher sensitivity than usual
systems for the same mass and volume. The sensitivity
of such device becomes, after simplification, for
frequencies lower than the resonant frequency :

Eq. 2

In our inverted tilted concept, described now in a
cylindrical reference, (/) is the moment of inertia, (kg) is
the rotational stiffness of the spring, (M') is the moment
of equilibrium and (@) is the tilt of the pendulum.
Behavior of this pendulum is very interesting, because
we can show than, theoretically, it is possible to have an
infinite sensitivity ! In fact the limitation comes from
the aptitude to adjust the equilibrium of the pendulum
when its frequency is getting close to zero.

On our instrument, the spring used is a leaf
spring (thickness close to 0.1 mm) permitting to reach a
low stiffness in a low volume.

The rotation of the pendulum is allowed in
point O by a leaf-cross pivot. This device is constituted
of alloy leafs cross-arranged between 2 rigid parts.
Optimization of this system permit to use it as a pivot :
fixing one of its rigid part, the other one can describe
motion located on a circle arc, for small angles. Leaf
elasticity is used : such system permits rotation with
very low damping.

On the first mock-up realized, the obtained
sensitivity is close to 10° s* with a free frequency close
to 1.5 Hz.

Damping in this type of pendulum must be
considered as an important point. Friction forces acting
directly on the pendulum generate damping.
Unfortunately these forces produce heat which induces
Brownian noise in the structure around its equilibrium
position.

For a vertical seismometer we can show [5] that this
noise is, expressed in spectral density of acceleration
(m.s?.Hz"”), related to the mobile mass (mm), the free
period (7) and the quality factor (Q) :

This white noise (spectral density constant in

the frequency bandwidth) provides the measurement
limitation for the instrument. Our scientific objective for
Mars is to reach a resolution better than 10!” m.s*.Hz
1° which means a (m.Q.7) product greater than 10.
For a terrestrial instrument this is generally obtained
with a free period close to few seconds, a quality factor
lower than 50, and a relatively high mass, between | kg
and 500 kg.

For our spatial instrument, the constraints are different :
with a mass lower than 100 g, we can not reach easily
high free periods and, the effort must be mainly done on
the quality factor. The technology used for the structure
is quite monolithic; technology of assembling is specific
to assume low dynamic loss. The spring has been
designed to reach a high (Q), looking to the loads
applied and to specific heat treatments.

The specific (Q) of the pendulum, reached for vacuum
close to 10° mbar is higher than 1000. As the main
structure has been designed to offer a minimum of
viscous damping in the air, it is still possible to reach

(Q) value higher than 100 for a vacuum near to 107
mbar, not so difficult to obtain and maintain.

Thermal properties of the pendulum are an
important problem too, when you want to measure
displacements close to a few tenth of picometers.
Thermal drifts of the structure and thermal variation of
mechanical properties produce variation on the
equilibrium of the pendulum. Efforts have been made in
the materials choice (titanium), in the main strucutre
geometry (optimized using finite element software) and
in the spring behavior. The thermo-mechanical
properties of the spring have been adjusted by heat
treatments to compensate the thermal drifts of the
mobile aggregate. Such concept permits to reach a
thermal sensitivity lower than 0.1 ym/K.

Figure _3_: Main titanium part of the structure
optimized to reach high mechanical properties, low
viscous damping in the air and low thermal drifts.
Dimensions : 7 cm x 3 cm, mass : 12 g.

An equilibrium mechanism has been designed
to balance the instrument. Sensors sensitivity used for
the displacement measurement of the mobile mass
requires to adjust the equilibrium of the pendulum with
an accuracy of about 2 um. This requirement is not so
trivial taking into account the fact that our instrument
must be able to operate in many areas of Mars, at
various altitudes (meaning various gravity’s). This
function is realized using a micro-motor with a high
ratio gear box coupled to a high precision screw on
which is mounted a small mass screw nut with take up
clearance. The reached positioning accuracy is around 1
um.
2.2 : The electronics :

The displacement measurement will be done by two
independent transducers :

— an Oscillating Cavity Sensor (OCS), producing
a digital tidal output (f < 10° Hz), with a
dynamic range of 32 bits;

— a Differential Capacity Sensor (DCS),
providing an analogue long period seismic
output (107-10 Hz), with a dynamic range of
140 dB (with a spectral noise close to 1
pm/Hz'” at 1 Hz).

Feedback, necessary for a such high (Q) and sensitive
instrument, is performed with both sensors, in order to
reduce the mechanical re-centring and to provide the
ideally continuous record necessary for tidal analysis.
The OCS contributes to the digital part, to prevent long
period drifts, and the DCS contributes to the analogue
part, permitting an adjustment of the gain, of the
instrument stability and of the resonance peak.

3. FIRST RESULTS :

Tests have been made using the mock-up realized. We
have used an STS-2 as a reference terrestrial
seismometer.

Results are very encouraging, because this first mock-up
shows performances close to the STS-2, with a (m.Q.T)
product close to 15 (STS-2 value is around 10).

Figure 6: Quake occurred in Afghanistan, recorded
by an STS-2 and by the VBB mock-up, on May 30,
1998. The signal was recorded in a seismic vault, in
Saint-Maur, France. The quake has a magnitude of
6.9. The STS-2 outputs were used to compute the
oblique output compared to the mock-up signal. Note
however that the breadboard was operating without
feedback and a slightly different place than the STS-2,
which may explain the small differences between the
two signals.

The actual performances make our instrument a
terrestrial good one. Martian objective implies a
minimum of one order of magnitude improvement. For
the future we plan to reach such performances looking
at a modified design, in which the pivot and the spring
will be differently loaded to have a better sensitivity.

4, NETLANDER INTEGRATION :

The instrument, which will be integrated on the
Netlander, will be composed of two-tilted axis
providing, after recombination, data of one horizontal
axis and one vertical axis. The limitation to two axis is
related to the size of the lander. However the use of a
micro-seismometer provided by JPL for the second
"missing" horizontal component allows __ the
measurement of all three axis signals.

All these sensors plus the proximity electronic take
place in an evacuated sphere of 13cm diameter (Fig. 7).

VBB axis and the JPL micro-seismometer. Sphere
diameter : 13 cm.

This sphere can be levelled and is supported by 3 small
passive feet in parallel with a larger active one.

This aggregate will be locked on the lander by 4
equatorial finger devices. All mechanisms will be
designed to support a landing shock of 200 g - 20 ms.

Figure 8 : Installation scenario of the seismometer.
Objective is to uncouple the instrument from the
lander and to assume a correct coupling with the
ground.

The seismometer deployment (Fig. 8) will start with the
descent of the main foot. This device is a penetrating
spike with an electro-mechanical hammer, with a design
originating from the ROSETTA- MUPUS spike. This
spike will anchor the sensor to the ground using the
lander as a reaction mass. In order to minimise the
power, this stage will be done over a few hours. If the
ground is not encountered (e.g., if a hole is under the
lander) or in case of problem, the seismometer will stay
coupled to the lander.

After the successful penetration of the foot, the
seismometer will be unlocked and will fall along the
main foot until the three small feet contact the ground.
The sphere containing the sensor will then be levelled
automatically (with an accuracy of a few fraction of
degree), and locked.

The system used for the seismometer deployment, even
if not comparable with a full robotic or human
installation, is therefore expected to provide a good
installation. The influence of the lander on the
seismometer will be minimised due to the enhanced de-
coupling and coupling with ground at high frequency (f
> 10 Hz). Finally, the lander will act as a thermal and
wind shield for the instrument. This system will be
designed to work for lander tilted up to about 30°.

The mass of the sensor head is about 700 g.
Total mass of the experiment, including locking,
leveling, deployment devices and electronics is about
1.9 kg.

Total power consumption is about 500 mW.

The first subassembly, the sensor, levelling
system, installation system, locking mechanism and
environmental sensors, as well as the overall instrument
integration will be under the responsibility of the Institut
de Physique du Globe de Paris, France (PI: P.
Lognonné). The second part of the sensor will be the
proximity electronics, a double-face electronic card for
the CDMS I/F , A/D and feedback electronics, and the
mass memory for the data logger. This part of the
experiment is under the responsibility of Switzerland,
Institiit of Geophysics (co-PI: D. Giardini). The last part
of the seismometer package will be the micro-
seismometers, either in the VBB sphere or on the spike.
This part will be under the responsibility of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, USA (co-PI, B. Banerdt).

5. CONCLUSION :

The NetLander mission is expected to provide the first
network on Mars. The preliminary expected
performances of the seismometer planned in the payload
will allow [6] to monitor the Martian seismic activity,
especially in the Tharsis area. Attempt to monitor the
continuous excitation of normal as well as the gravity
tides of the Sun and Phobos will also be performed.

The NetLander mission, presently in phase A, is
expected to start phase B in 2000, for a delivery of the
instrument in late 2003-early 2004. After a launch in
mid 2005, the seismic network will operate from early
2006 to early 2008, during therefore one Martian year.
With these new seismic data, much of the unknown
internal structure of Mars will be discovered, a second
telluric planet might therefore be characterized.
